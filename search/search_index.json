Phrasa build upon the traditional definition and extend into a much more abstract form. In Phrasa, a musical piece is by itself a single phrase, that is made out of multiple phrases that are made from more phrases and so on. Ratios Phrases durations are perceived in relation to each other. The relative durations of the phrases helps the listener to keep up with the piece, and build upon it's expectations. In phrasa we describe the length of a phrase as a ratio with relation to it's father phrase. By defining with length property of a phrase is defined relatively to its parent, for example '/4' or 'X2'. If the phrase contains inner phrases, the actual length will be the sum of them all multiiplied by it's own length. For example, if a phrase with a length of 1, contains 4 phrases of length 1/4, the final length will be 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 = 1. If the same phrase contains 5 phrases of length 1/4 it's final length will be 5/4. A phrase with the length of 2, containing 3 phrases of 1/4, will end up with the length of 3/4 X 2 = 6/4 Phrasa Expression Everything in Phrasa is either a value, a list of values or an expression. A value is defined in a single word without spaces. for example beat , 140bpm or 1/4 . A list of values are multiple values seperated with , or a newline within the same indentation. For example 1, 2.4235, 3/6 or: 1 2 3 snare kick drum arrays within arrays can be defined: 1 23,(10,20),33 or 1 2 3 23 10,20 33 An expression can be though of as a simple sentance consisting of 2 parts, a subject and an object. They can either be separated with spaces, for example: 1 tempo 120bpm or indented in a new line: 1 2 tempo 120bpm This expression sets the tempo (the subject) to 120 bpm (the object) The expression input can either be a value, such as above, or it can be a list of values: cool_sequence 10,20,10 or: 1 2 3 4 cool_sequence 10 20 30 expression input can also be an expression by itself, defined in a single row by encosing with paranthesis, for example 1 cool_event.offset (random 10%-40%)or in a new line:cool_event.offset random 10%-40% or: 1 2 3 cool_event.offset random 10%-40% And of course it can also be a list of expression/values, for example: 1 2 3 phrases.1 pitch.grid (chord Maj-C) // an expression which defines the pitch in the 1st phrase to be around the C Major chord. beat // a value that defines the 1st phrase as the beat phrase The most common type is the assignment expression which are at the core of Phrasa, functioning as instructions for updating the piece Tree.

If you feel confused at some part, don't worry, in the next Concepts section we will start right at the beginning and explore Phrasa in much more detail. This guide presumes you have a minimal understanding about music and sound. If you are unfamiliar with terms like frequency, scales or tempo you might want to begin with Phrasa's Music & Sound Cheatsheet , or jump to it at any time. Installation Before we begin, you should download and install Phrasa Control from here . Keep in mind This version of Phrasa Control is limited, experimental and unmatured - expect great things to come in the very near future. Hello Sound Ok, let's play sound. Open 'Phrasa Control', type the following text and press on the play button: 1 2 3 4 5 6 tempo 102bpm beat instrument plain event frequency 440 end 50% We defined and played the most basic Phrasa structure - a single section containing a single event playing repeatedly. The first expression tempo 102bpm sets tempo to 102bpm . The second line beat defines this section as the beat length. (it will make more sense in the next section). In the third line we define the instrument to be played, in this case it's name is plain . You can try other instruments listed in here....... Then we define a musical event that contains the following properties: Frequency of 440 hertz End time of 50% the section length. Sections Let's make things slightly more interesting, adding some notes to be played: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 tempo 240bpm instrument jupiter-8 sections.1.event.note C4 sections.2.event.note D3 sections.3.event.note G3 sections.4.event.note F3 sections.1 beat In lines 3-6, we divide the piece into 4 musical sections, each contains an event to be sent to the instrument jupiter-8 with the property note . Here is an illustration of the piece sections: A 'section' is a fixed time frame where events can occur. Every section can be divided into inner sections. The final expression sections.1 beat defines the first section as the beat length of the piece (see picture above). It means that the tempo (in this case 135 beats per minute) will be relative to the duration of this section. To make our code a bit less repetitive we can use the mighty selector symbol - # : 1 2 3 4 5 6 instrument jupiter-8 sections.#.event.note 1 C5 2 D3 3 G3 4 F3 Harmony Phrasa provides you with tools to write music with musical concepts in mind. One example is Relativity - a core abstract concept that underline chords, scales, rhythms and many other applications. In this example, instead of writing down the actual note as we did before, we can write the offset in relation to its harmonic context: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 tempo 135bpm sections.1 beat instrument jupiter-8 pitch.grid (chord b-min) pitch.zone b3 sections.total 8 sections.#.event.pitch 1 -3 2 0 4 3 7 4 Lines 4-5 define the harmonic context. pitch.grid defines the set of notes, in this case 'B minor' chord in all octaves. pitch.zone defines the initial position within the grid. In this case, the note 'B' in the 3rd octave. The expression sections.total 8 sets the total number of sections to 8 (if this property is not set, total sections will be equal to the last section assigned) In lines 9-13 we set events for sections 1,4,6 and 7. The value of pitch defines the offset within the previously defined harmonic context. Reusing Patterns Another example for a core musical concept is Repetition . It is probably the most notable element of music, right there within the physical nature of any periodic sound. Music without repetition is pure random sound, or more technically - noise. In Phrasa you can reuse repeated elements in different ways. One way define multiple sections in a single expression: sections.x-y or sections.x,y , and then make variations over them: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 tempo 127bpm instrument jupiter-8 pitch grid (chord c-maj) zone g4 sections.1-4 sections.1 beat sections.1-4.sections.#.event.pitch 2 0 4 1 sections.#.sections.3.event.pitch 1 -1 2 2 sections.3-4.pitch.grid (chord g-maj) By setting multiple sections collectively, we are keeping all their shared properties in one place. This will make our piece much more flexible. Here is a diagram that illustrates the resulted sections and and events: Imagine how hard you had to work writing these events one by one, and even harder if you wanted to make a change. This is the power of reusability. Sequencing Until now we have played with musical elements based on the concepts of hierarchy and repetition. Now let's play with another fundamental concept of perceiving time - continuity . For this we have our old pal - the sequencer: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 tempo 125bpm instrument jupiter-8 pitch grid (scale g-maj) zone g3 sequences.ascending 1,3,4,5,7 sections.1-4 beat sections.1-4.event.pitch (sequences.ascending >) sections.4.pitch.grid (scale d-maj) In line 7 we defines a sequence of values by the name ascending . In line 10 we assign the expression (sequences.ascending >) to the the property pitch . Each of the events assigned to this expression, will increment the sequence position by one (as indicated by the symbol > ) and use the current value of the sequence. Here is an illustration of the outcome: Multiple Instruments Not supported . So we had all these cool stuff with a single instrument, so let's branch out and have multiple instruments playing together. Also, to make our code more readable and manageable we're gonna write down the piece in multiple files: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 tempo 130bpm pitch grid (scale g-maj) zone g3 use drums use bass cool.piece 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 branches.cymbals instrument drums sections.1-8 sections.#.event.sample 1 cym1 2 cym2 branches.kicks sections.total 16 sections.1 beat sections.1,5,8,14.drums.event sample kick sections.5,8.drums.event sample snare drums.motif 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 branches.bass instrument bass-8 sequences.ascending 1,3,4,5,7 sections.1-4 beat sections.1-4.event.pitch (sequences.ascending >) sections.4.pitch.grid (scale d-maj) bass.motif The main file of this piece is cool.piece which defines the base pitch and tempo. The use expressions import the entire content of an external .motif file. In the motif files we created 3 branches: cymbals , kicks and bass . A branch is a new section derived from the context of it's parent section, taking it's own path with it's own inner sections, sequences and other things. It gives you the freedom to create multiple parallel structures and define events within each of them.","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"getting_started/#getting-started","text":"This getting started session is intended to demonstrate what you can do with Phrasa, without getting too deep into syntax and terms.
