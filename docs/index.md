###What is Phrasa?



Phrasa is a music make language.



It was born out of the idea that most music can be broken down to sections within sections, repeating themselves as a whole or in some variation.

Each section is called a **Phrase**.

Phrasa is the tool for writing down the hierarchy of the musical piece, reusing phrases and harmony.

Writing music with Phrasa allow your musical piece to <span style="color:blueviolet">**grow**</span>, instead writing down a rigid sequence of notes, you build a flexible structure of phrases and events.
