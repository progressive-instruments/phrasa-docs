# What is Phrasa?



Phrasa is a music making language.



It was born out of the idea that most music can be broken down into sections within sections, repeating themselves as a whole or in some variation.

We call each section - a musical **Phrase**.

Phrasa is the tool for writing down the hierarchy of a musical piece, reusing phrases and harmony.

Writing music with Phrasa allow your musical piece to <span style="color:limegreen">**G <span style="font-size:110%">R</span> <span style="font-size:120%">O</span> <span style="font-size:130%">W</span>**</span>.

Instead writing down a rigid sequence of notes, you build a flexible structure of phrases and events.
