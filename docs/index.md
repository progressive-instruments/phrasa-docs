# What is Phrasa?



Phrasa is a music making language.

It is based upon the understanding that most of the music in our world can be broken down to sections within sections, and that these sections often repeat themselves throughout the musical piece, either in their original form or with some variation.

Phrasa is the tool for writing down music within this musical structure. It supports the musician throughout his/hers creation process by allowing him/her to  <span style="color:LightSkyBlue">**<span style="font-size:110%">R</span> <span style="font-size:90%">e</span> <span style="font-size:100%">u</span> <span style="font-size:110%">s</span> <span style="font-size:95%">e</span>**</span>  musical elements.

With Phrasa - your musical piece is free to <span style="color:limegreen">**G <span style="font-size:110%">R</span> <span style="font-size:120%">O</span> <span style="font-size:130%">W</span>**</span>.

Instead writing down a rigid sequence of notes and audio, you create a flexible structure of sections and musical events.
